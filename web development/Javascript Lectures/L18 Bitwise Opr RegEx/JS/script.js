Operator	Name	                     Description
&	        AND	               Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
|	        OR	               Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
^	        XOR	               Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
~	        NOT	               Inverts all the bits
<<	   Zero fill left shift	   Shifts left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off

>>	   Signed right shift	   Shifts right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off

>>>	   Zero fill right shift   Shifts right by pushing zeros in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off

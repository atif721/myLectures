// basic redux
npm init -y
npm install redux
import in node Const redux = require(‘redux’);
We need to setup all 4 basic things:
1. Reducer
2. Store
3. Subscriber
4. Actions
node redux-demo.js command to run node server

//redux with react

Npm install redux
Npm install react-redux
Create store folder with Index.js file
Creating the store using
  Import {createStore} from redux.

Providing the store with react
  1. Provider from react-redux
  2. <Provider store={store}><App /></Provider>

Using the store
  1. useSelector hook gets a slice of the store.
  Const counter = useSelector(state => state.counter);
  2. Subscription is already setup and only will re-execute when only your slice is changed. Subscription is automatically cleared also.

Dispatch Actions using the useDispatch hook.




// redux-toolit react

Npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
Remove redux from package.json
Import {createSlice} from “@reduxjs/toolkit”
Slices of the store can be created using the following syntax:
Const slice = createSlice({
  name: "”,
  initialState: {},
  reducers: {
  smallReducerMethods: (state, action) => {
  },
  }
})

ConfigureStore combines multiple reducers and can be used as:
configureStore({
  reducer: {name: slice.reducer}
}) 
Export actions = slice.actions;
Actions can be dispatched like: actions.reducerMethod(payload);
